The simulator provides support to the hex generator tool and also supports the testbench by providing various API calls through DPI support in system verilog. 
The source code is organised in the following 
manner: 
iss/src/ - contains the .c and .h files
iss/lib/ - contains the lib files required

Currently, the simulator processes each instruction by first decoding it to decide whether it is a R-type or I-type or J-type instruction and then proceeds with 
the execution by evaluating the case statement using  either the opcode field value of the instruction or the function field value, whichever is applicable. The 
simulator also supports the architecture register  dumps as well as the memory dump for a range of  addresses. These utility functions help in the debugging process. 
Please go through the source code to understand more about the implementation technique. The current simulator supports MIPS instruction set and support for other 
instruction set simulators (ARM, x86) is in progress!

Running the generated hex file on the simulator - 
Inside iss/ directory:
  make sim
  ./sim
 (Note: Make sure instr_hex and pc_values_hex files are present inside iss/ directory)
 
 To create lib files for RTL (to use C-DPI calls)
   make iss
   Copy the lib file to the RTL directory
   
 To create lib files for Hex-gen 
   make hex
   Copy the lib file to hex_gen/lib directory
